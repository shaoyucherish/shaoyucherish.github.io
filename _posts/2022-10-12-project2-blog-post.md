For this project, our goal is to create a vignette for reading and summarizing data from the APIs. At first, my group partner and I used the Beer API and tried to get any interesting findings. Even though we spent many days on it, we could not find any interesting results since it lacked numeric data. But it was worth that I practised creating different functions and tried to improve these functions to find what data I want. After that, we had a zoom meeting to discuss switching the Beer API to Food API. Food API is more complex. We could get more numerical and graphical summaries to perform our exploratory data analysis (EAD). We created the search functions to contact Food API and parsed the data. Then we used some contingency tables, bar plots, histograms, box plots and scatter plots to analyze our data. I think the most difficult part is to program numerical and graphical summaries, especially for using the outputs to describe my findings. In the future project, I will try to create more complex functions, for example, when the user has the inputs and get the graphical outputs directly. Here is the [rendered github pages](https://nmlevin11.github.io/Project2/) and the [regular repo](https://github.com/nmlevin11/Project2). Welcome any comments!
