• explain what you did in the project and any interesting findings

• reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?

– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

• provide a link to the rendered github pages repo and the regular repo (non-github pages site) as well!

For [this project](https://nmlevin11.github.io/Project2/), our goal is to create a vignette for reading and summarizing data from the APIs. At first, my group partner and I used the Beer API and tried to get any interesting findings. Even though we spent many days on it, we could not find any interesting results since it lacks numeric data. But it was worth that I practised creating different functions to search in API and tried to improve these functions to find what data I want. After that, we had a zoom meeting to discuss switching the Beer API to Food API. Food API is more complex. We can get more numerical and graphical summaries to perform our exploratory data analysis (EAD). For the food API, I created the search functions to contact my API and parsed the data.
