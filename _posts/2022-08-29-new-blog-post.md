- What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model and spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation.

- What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

Data scientists closely follow the "data science process" that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling.

- What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Statisticians focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. The two fields also use somewhat different nomenclature to describe the same principles.

- How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Although data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes, their means of data collection are quite different. Data science can be described as the description, prediction, and causal inference from both structured and unstructured data. This discipline helps individuals and enterprises make better business decisions. The field of data science employs computer science disciplines like mathematics and statistics and incorporates techniques like data mining, cluster analusis, visualization and machine learning. However, statisticians still rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments.
