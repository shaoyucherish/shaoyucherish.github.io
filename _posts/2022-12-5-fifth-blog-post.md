Through the course of Data Science for Statisticians, I am more familiar with R, RStudio and R Markdown. I have learnt four main units: 1. R as an Environment for Data Science; 2. Data, Collaboration, and Efficiency; 3. Statistical/MachineLearning; 4. Scaling & Sharing Analyses. Before this course, I usually use R script, but after this course, I find R Markdown is more convenient, especially for creating reports. I also utilize more R packages to do programs, such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `tidyr` and so on. I gain more experiences about how to explore data and perform common analyses, how to create reports, web pages, and dashboards to display and communicate results, how to perform dimension reduction and fit different models, how to use GitHub. At last, I have learnt how to create shiny application. That is a lot of things I learnt from this course. All of these will be very helpful and valuable for my future practice.

After I finish this fall term, there will be only one course left in spring term 2023, and at that time I will start to find a job. I hope to find a job in relation to data science, like data analyst. I need to learn and do more practice in exploratory data analysis, variable selection, dimension reduction. Data science is a huge field, I believe there are many things I have not learnt yet. I should keep learning and exploring in my future career.
