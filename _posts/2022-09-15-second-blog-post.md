## Second Blog

I have just completed my [first project](https://github.com/shaoyucherish/shaoyu/blob/main/Project1.html) for the course Data Science for Statisticians. The purpose of this project is to write functions that will manipulate and process data sets that come in a certain form, and I create a *generic* function to automatically plot the returned data. For this project, there are four parts: data processing, call it and combine the data, writing a generic function for summarizing, and put it together. I followed the steps to process the data in the first part, and then write the functions, and use these functions at last. We test out the functions to combine data and plot what we want. This is the first time for me to write and use functions, it is a useful method to process data sets. During this project, I met with many problems and issues, but I finally solved them. It is a challenging project for me. However, when I completed it, it was rewarding in the end. I have learnt a lot through this project.
